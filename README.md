# QGIS Plugin for Relief Visualization Toolbox

![](./docs/figures/RVT_head.png)

Relief Visualization Toolbox was produced to help scientist visualize raster elevation model datasets. We have narrowed down the selection to include techniques that have proven to be effective for identification of small scale features. Default settings therefore assume working with high resolution digital elevation models, derived from airborne laser scanning missions (lidar).


## Installation

Plugin is uploaded to QGIS plugin repository [Relief visualization toolbox, QGIS plugin repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/rvt-qgis/).

To install plugin open QGIS and go to:

```
Plugins > Manage and install plugins... > Search Relief Visualization Toolbox > Install
```

The plugin has been tested under QGIS 3.12 and later.

## Documentation

Documentation of the QGIS plugin is available at [Relief Visualization Toolbox QGIS Plugin](https://rvt-qgis.readthedocs.io/).

RVT Python documentation is available at [Relief Visualization Toolbox]([Relief Visualization Toolbox — Relief Visualization Toolbox in Python documentation](https://rvt-py.readthedocs.io).
